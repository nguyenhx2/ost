Review the current changes before opening or merging a PR.

1. Get the diff: `git diff` and `git diff --staged`. For an existing branch use
   `git diff main...HEAD` (three dots, merge-base to tip). Two dots on a stale
   branch reports commits the branch is merely missing as deletions, producing false findings.
2. Run `/secret-scan`. Any real secret or sensitive data in the diff is a blocker: stop until the
   value is removed from the diff and the credential is rotated.
3. Dispatch `code-reviewer`: coding standards, `.claude/rules/`, and the commit messages on the
   branch (`git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%s`) against Conventional Commits.
4. Dispatch `security-reviewer`: secret handling, sensitive data, guardrails, the security
   non-functional requirements in `docs/specs/`.
5. Dispatch `spec-guardian`: verify the acceptance criteria of the linked FR and task are met.
6. Confirm `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D
   warnings` pass locally, and that the GitHub Actions `lint-and-test` pipeline is green in a terminal
   state. A pending pipeline is not a green pipeline.
7. Aggregate the findings by severity: blocker, should fix, suggestion. Record the review in the
   task file session log; a gate counts as passed only when the log records the run.

Do not merge and do not deploy. Reviewing is not approving.
